# BTHS-Cybersecurity-Club

The goal of cybersecurity club is to introduce beginners with little to no experience to basic concepts. Students will utilize this knowledge and apply it in high school and global cybersecurity competitions such as Capture the Flag.

This repository is intended to be a resource for club members and anyone in the world who would like to learn about cybersecurity in a fun and interactive way. This program aims to give motivated learners a safe enviornment to experiment, create and break things without the intimidation of textbooks and legal reprecussions. 

The topics covered each week will be briefly summarized here on GitHub in case anyone misses a week or other people out there on the internet are looking for a resource. Any tools or resources mentioned in or out of the workshops will also be included here, as well as any important links.

Workshops are held after 10th period at Brooklyn Technical High School on Thursdays in room 5E7.
