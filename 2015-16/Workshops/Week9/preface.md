#Reverse Engineering

Sign in to this weeks club [here](http://bit.ly/bthscyber)!

This weeks presentation can be found [here](https://goo.gl/ErLUDN).

This week we will be learning how to reverse engineer programs. We will be using Python and we recommend following along with us. If you would like to use a different language go for it but we cannot help you.

To get started, make sure you have Python installed. We will be using Python 2, not 3.
If you are using a linux/unix environment (like the butterfly servers or a mac) you already have it.
Simply enter `python` into your terminal and a python shell will open. To escape this shell use Ctrl+D or enter `exit()`.

If you are using windows you can install python by going to their [website](http://python.org) but we would prefer you use [Babun](http://babun.github.io) instead as it includes python and many other tools we will be using.

You can run python code in the python shell or by saving your code in a file that ends in ".py" and entering `python myprogram.py` in the terminal.

In this folder your will find a [tutorial](tutorial.py) to get you started on the basics of python. If you are completely new to programming with little to no expereince I recommend taking a look at [this](http://kchung.co/public/python/tutorial/1_firststeps.md) first. You can find anything else you need in the excellent python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/) and of course the rest of the internet.
