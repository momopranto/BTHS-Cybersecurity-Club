# File Forensics

**[Click here to sign in for today's meeting](http://bit.ly/bthscyber).**

This week we will dive into the world of files. 
By now, everyone should either have access to the [server](http://128.238.66.241:57575) or bring in their laptop.
This week will be very interactive so don't forget to bring your laptop and have a VM set up.
If you do not have credentials to the server please let one of the executives know and we will try to help you asap.

We will be covering [file signature analysis](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html), [steganography](http://www.garykessler.net/library/steganography.html), and more.
Exercises and resources will be available on this github as well.

Be there or be square!
